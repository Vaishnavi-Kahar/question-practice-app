    question:
      "A block P of mass m is placed on a horizontal frictionless plane. The second block of the same mass m is placed on it and is connected to a spring of spring constant k. The two blocks are pulled by a distance A. Block Q oscillates without slipping. What is the maximum value of the frictional force between the two block.",

    answer: {
      option: "kA/2",
      explanation:
        "The Mona Block Q oscillates but does not slip on P. It means that acceleration is the same for Q and P both. There is a force of friction between the two blocks while the horizontal plane is frictionless. The spring is connected to the upper block. The (P – Q) system oscillates with angular frequency ω. The spring is stretched by A.",
